I am a data analyst. This is a project I am involved in. It's latest version is Pro_3 and it's the most complete version available. The aim of this project is to grab the prices of UK whisky from the Wine Prices website and then compare them with the declared data to identify companies that are under-reporting their prices. The price comparison methodology uses a fuzzy-fuzzy approach. The idea is to filter 95% of the wines with matching names, and then match the origin and vintage, and if the vintage can't find a counterpart, then compare wines with a vintage difference of up to 5 years.
As for how to crawl wine pricing sites to grab the price of a specific vintage, see another project UKWhisky_pro.
I was supposed to upload my business declaration comparison data, but for some reason I can't show it. All I can say is that they are absolutely conclusive.
